## What is Songbox? ##
Songbox is an quick-n-dirty MP3 downloader. Plug in a search in the box at the top, hit the 'Search' button
and you'll be on your merry way to oodles of free music.

## How does it work? ##
We ask our friends over at [Seeqpod](http://seeqpod.com) for the locations of the music that you're looking for.
Once we have those locations we give you the download button and make sure the file is saved to the right place.

## Why don't some of the songs download? ##
We're working on the problem, but it's a tough one. A good portion of the time we try to download files that
don't exist or have been taken down.
