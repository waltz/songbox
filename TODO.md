## Todo List

Stuff that needs to get done, in no particular order.

* Save downloaded files to a subdirectory.
* Multiple results pages. Users should be able to browse more search results if they exist.
* Don't always display the download progress bar.
* Do some kind of preliminary check before downloading (or saving?) a file. Make sure the file
exists, make sure the mimetype is correct.
